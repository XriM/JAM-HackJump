## What is HackJump ?
HackJump is a platform game created with the SFML library (in C). The player will have to hack the game to successfully finish it. You can hack by clicking the "T" touch in your keyboard, wich will open a terminal,
You will then be able to enter some commands such as:
- Switch: switch some blocks.
- Restart: kill your character, you will restart from 0.
- The secret command: (you will have to find it by yourself!!)
## Demonstration
(some gif might freeze during the animations, it is not the case on the real program)
